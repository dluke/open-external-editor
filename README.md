# What?

First see readme for the original plugin at: https://github.com/calviken/open-external-editor

The calviken solution did not fit well with my workflow so his implementation of his button is changed to toggle the external editor setting and change color. 

# Installation

Create a folder named `addons` in your project's base folder and clone this repository into it.
The result should look like `.../my-project/addons/open-external-editor/`
